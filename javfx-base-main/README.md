## JavaFX base
this is a base project - with all the dependencies you need for JavaFX and JUnit - change the artifact id to your needs 
(see FIXME in the pom.xml). the Launcher and App maybe
reused for your project if you have no specific needs - the Controller, and the Tests
can be removed.

## Improvements
if you think this project can be improved create a Merge Request ;)
